Tensorflow Convolutional Auto Encoder

A 7 layers auto-encoder with TensorFlow Convolutional layers
trains on noised MNIST set. Supposed to do some serious denoising.
Also it saves and automaticaly restores the model and does visualisation.
The work is derived from a source code by Manish Chablani.
